I just got my digital [MetaWatch][metawatch] this morning after 3 months of delays from TI.

I'm still playing around with the watch. Currently just got the Android apk
installed on my phone and paired the watch to it. ~~There was no default UI
to change the time~~, *I was too lazy to read the user guide*, so I really needed to pair to use this as a watch.

There will be a more in-depth post soon, but here are a couple of pictures of the watch.
