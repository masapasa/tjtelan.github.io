## Major life change
About a month from my [last post](@/blog/2020-02-14-published-first-crate-on-crates-io.md) was about when COVID started getting serious here in the PNW and I was furloughed by my employer. Since then I've pretty much been doing a lot of recovery from the worst burnout I've suffered in recent memory. (I considered writing a post about it. Maybe in the future I can share.) I am fortunate that my Partner is still employed and I am able to use this time to focus on myself.

## Orbital
Progress on [OrbitalCI](https://github.com/orbitalci/orbital) continues! I'm happy to say that it's reached an important milestone. The basic workflow of a client triggering a build for the server to run in a Docker container was already working. But now the client receives live logs from the server. I'll be taking a little bit of a break from development so I can work on updating this blog.

## Blogging and more?

I want to take this blog a little more seriously because I enjoy writing. I'm going to be addressing a few aesthetic changes I've been thinking about, as well as introducing an email newsletter. The future is very uncertain, and I want to take some creative chances that make me uncomfortable when I think about it too hard.

As an observer of The Internet for many years, it can be surprisingly kind when you make an honest effort. I hope it will be kind to me.
