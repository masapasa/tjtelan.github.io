Been a while since my last major edit. I'm reacquainting myself with this static site generator. It's called [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) now.

I am trying to test out the rss generator so I can see how it looks in a reader like feedly.

Still playing around with rust, and doing micro-architecture/container stuff. Gearing up to start posting again while I have a lot of documentation to write about what I've learned.
