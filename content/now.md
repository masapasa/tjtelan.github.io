I finished configuring Github Actions to build and deploy my zola site. Now this is as convenient as using Github Page's Jekyll engine.

Check out the Github Action I used on the marketplace: [zola-deploy-to-pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/zola-deploy-to-pages)

Lately, I've been coding on my nights and weekends completing an alpha for [Orbital CI](https://github.com/orbitalci/orbital). I plan on having this done late Februrary / early March.

I will be writing about the past and current experience writing this project in Rust this year. I learned how to write a structured cli, write GRPC services, use docker and more. All while writing a lot of good-enough Rust code.
