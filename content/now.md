The challenge of making the best of a very uncertain situation... I feel like I'm able to take it on now.

I'm very fortunate that my partner has been able to support the both of us. It's with that structure that I have been able to take all of these risks and invest in myself.

I just posted a [reflection](@/blog/2020-09-22-reflections-after-2-months-of-live-coding.md) of my summer experience with streaming on Twitch.

Honestly, Twitch has been going better than I expected with the effort I have been putting in. I'm committing more into improving my viewership with experiments in how I market and network within the Rust and larger tech communities that I am a part of. I plan on increasing the frequency of streams once I set up more systems to manage my time and keep myself accountable.

I'm also experimenting with syndicating onto more platforms, and submitting my blog posts directly to other sites. [Dev.to](https://dev.to) has been great for me, and I'm eyeing Reddit and Medium.
