+++

I'm in Seattle: The epicenter of the the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Instead of my usual routine of taking the bus to to my employer's Downtown office, I am working from home. And so is my significant other.

Before I begin, we both work in tech and have been together for 10+ years. Compare your experience with this in mind.

# Workspace
I am a little timid admitting this given the state of housing affordability in the city, but we own our home. We have dedicated office space in the our unfinished basement that works for the short term.

We share the following in our workspace:
* Desk 
  * This is a table left from a former roommate. It is from Ikea.
* Overhead Lights
  * These are 2 overhead lights above us on a shared Ikea dimmer switch.
* Space heater
  * It is quite cold in the basement, and this is very necessary during most times of the year.

We each have the following in this space:
* Laptops
  * Our employers both provided us with Apple Macbooks.
* External monitor
  * This is a monitor we bought for ourselves far in the past for the purposes of working from home.
* External keyboard
  * We happen to both have external mechanical keyboards since we spend all day typing and the laptop keyboard gets a little uncomfortable to use at our desks.
* Chair w/ a back
  * Hers is a wooden chair from our dining table. Mine is a padded drum throne from a drum-kit from 15+ years ago. More opinion on these later.

# Mornings
Our mornings have not significantly changed, but I'll quickly summarize.

I usually wake first when our dog Fig gets me up. I drink a glass of water and take Fig out for a walk around the neighborhood or a nearby park. ~30-60 min depending on the weather.

By the time we get back it's about time for my partner's morning meetings.

Recommendation: Establish a morning routine. I actively avoid the news cycle and work chat until after I've run through this routine.

# Video meetings
I only had a few meetings over video for the entire week. My partner has many meetings in a day. This isn't very ideal in a shared space. 

Fun aside: Whenever she was in a meeting I would get up to stretch, or pace around somewhere away from our desk. I didn't know I was always in the background of her video later in the week. 

# Sitting
At my work office, I have an adjustable height desk. I would frequently go between sitting in an office chair and standing throughout the day. At my home office I sit at a desk primarily. 

Note for future self: Invest in a higher quality chair that has some support in the back.

# Distractions
Our dog is also surprised and confused that I'm home and wants me to know he's happy to see us.

I'm used to taking breaks while I'm thinking something over by walking around the work office, which sometimes leads to random conversation. And that scenario is now limited to my partner and my dog, which isn't best for both our our productivity.

There's quite a lot of new going on. Reestablishing a sense team cohesion, verifying lines of communication with my teammates, collaborating over Slack when previously was face-to-face -- These changes will take time to get used to before we can even think about going back to business as usual.

The bulk of the WFH stuggle are these distractions. These moments will become the norm, and their novelty will wear off. Allow yourself to experience some of these distractions for a moment. If you have a desire to become productive, you can get through the distractions.

# Ending the day
Ending the day doesn't have a lot of structure at the moment. Work hours don't exactly fit a standard 9-5 window, but we try to be done by 7 at the latest. I leave my work laptop at my desk for tomorrow morning. We prepare dinner together and make an effort to spend non-work brain time together.

# Takeaways for the near future

We moved our office space around at the end of the weekend as an attempt to improve the working conditions. With more social distancing in the future, we'll get a chance to evaluate whether these changes are for the better.

* Establish a morning routine
* Get dressed every day. Don't get used to working in your PJs
* Communicate w/ your partner to minimize the work day distractions.
* Invest in some headphones and a decent microphone.
* Invest in a good chair!
* Spend some quality time with your partner at the end of the day
* Don't bring work out of the office
