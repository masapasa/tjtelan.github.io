I am in the process of migrating away from my self-hosted Wordpress to the Github-hosted [Github Pages][githubpages], powered by [Jekyll][jekyll].

I was finding it difficult to motivate myself to write when my wordpress comments kept getting hit by bots. Please excuse the plain styling while I get the hang of using Jekyll.
