Without further delay, I'd like to post the first of several detailed posts about the new [MetaWatch][metawatch] that I received (after a [couple][engadget-metawatch-1] [announcements][engadget-metawatch-2] of delays) with a pretty brief unboxing post.

(I clearly already opened it immediately after I got it, but this is how it looked.)

[Unboxing pics]

The next post will be more focused on the watch itself. More pictures too.

Edit: Removed the links and the unboxing pics. Never got around to finishing the Metawatch first impression posts, but I still have it so I'll obviously be posting on any projects related to it.
