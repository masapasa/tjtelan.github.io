My name is T.J. Telan. I am a software engineer based in Seattle.

I appreciate well-designed software systems (especially clever, embedded systems), thoughtful hardware design, and I have a soft spot for elegant, calculated laziness (automation).

I like to experiment with designing, building and learning. Occasionally I write about tech.
