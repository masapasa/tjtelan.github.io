My name is T.J. Telan. I am a software engineer based in Seattle. This blog serves as a space where I host my writing. Hopefully the quality of posts will improve over time. Or not, who knows? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Mostly I write about new, or current technology that I am interested in. I like to experiment with designing, building and learning of a variety of technology topics.

Some topics that interest me:
* Explanation of complex software systems
* Automation
* Programming languages
* Security
* Hardware design
* Open Source software
