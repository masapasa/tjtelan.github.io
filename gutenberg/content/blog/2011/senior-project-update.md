Presentations are just around the corner and I haven't been making quite as many updates with regard to my project.

The quick summary will have to do for now: It is using an ARM based microcontroller (Freescale Kinetis K60 -- tower system). The function it is serving is web-enabled home automation. I'm using the MQX real-time operating system. Users of this system will control the devices connected to the system through a web browser.

The code for this project is up on github, so anyone can contribute, customize for themselves or just look at the [code][github-homewatchdog].

I plan to have a reflection up after next Thursday.

*Deep breath*

Still so much to add.
