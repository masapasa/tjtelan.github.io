# What I'm doing now

This is a now page, inspired by [Derek Sivers' now page](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm working on updating this site so I can use it more. Re-learning how to use jekyll, and other frontend stuff.

I'm starting to write some content ideas and looking for ways to include content that requires less work than articles.

I'm learning Rust, and I'm constantly looking for ways I can use it for something practical, so I can find some motivation to explore the language.

I'm working extensively with Docker and Ansible
