I succeeded in having my first PR accepted to an open source project: https://github.com/TerryHowe/ansible-modules-hashivault

Decided not to go to Defcon, in lieu of possibly going to RustConf, and take some of the training sessions.

Took a long break from writing, but I need to get back to editing my posts.

Today, my goal is to raise my reputation on a few of the Stack Exchange sites. Enough that I can vote on things with some public impact.
