I'm playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. (I still haven't finished Zelda : BoTW...)

I'm doing a lot of more system design, and less coding right now. Looking secrets management with Vault for use in a container cluster.

I'm working on a series of new posts to document my first experiences with writing something "real" in Rust.
