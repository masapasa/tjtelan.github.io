I'm cleaning up the site layouts, and customizing the styles.

I'm starting to write some content ideas and looking for ways to include content that requires less work than articles.

I'm learning Rust, and I'm constantly looking for ways I can use it for something practical, so I can find some motivation to explore the language.

I'm working extensively with Docker and Ansible
