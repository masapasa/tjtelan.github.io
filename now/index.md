I'm playing Zelda : BoTW. I think I'm almost done. Doing the trials in the Lost Woods.

I'm doing a lot of build automation right now. Using services like Jenkins, Shippable, and Docker Hub to build automatically for me.

I'm having to learn a lot about how different build toolchains work in different languages, and how their package managers work, with Artifactory as a repository, and how to modify their build steps. Java and Maven. Node, npm, and gulp. Docker images, as a portable tool container.

I've been thinking about the direction to take my posts. Going to try to document more of my process, as opposed to only writing complete thoughts with summarized conclusions. Maybe a little less perfectionism will result in more posting?
