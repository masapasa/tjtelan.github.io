I'm writing a lot of new code, as opposed to exclusively designing system architecture, building, and deploying other people's code

I'm looking forward to cleaning up my first open source contribution, and sending a pull request.

Still working with Rust. I have a small series of posts I'm almost done writing for a first draft.

Playing Nintendo Switch. Street Fighter 2 (waiting for Smash 4 to even be acknowledged).
So far, maining Ryu, but looking...

Thinking (very late) about going to Defcon this year. I wonder if there are still hotel rooms nearby?...
